# Final-Project-1
[Yummy-Food-Recipes Web Application]

This project, which is an essential step on the road to becoming full-stack developers, challenges us to apply the information and abilities we have learned during the coding bootcamp to create a web application from scratch.

The task is to come up with and putting into practice a design that incorporates data from several server-side API queries to address a real-world issue.

This project seeks to teach us agile development approaches as well as how to integrate features and bug fixes utilizing git branch workflow and pull requests because we will be working collaboratively.

## User Story
<br>

AS A person with an extremely busy schedule who likes to cook or is learning to cook, THE USER IS SEEKING A WEBSITE APPLICATION TO FIND FOOD RECIPE BY INGREDIENTS, So that the user can locate recipes that he or she can simply follow in the shortest amount of time while still allowing him or her to use ingredients that are already in the cupboard or refrigerator.

## Installation
<br>

The application runs in a browser and can be viewed at: https://jasonjayoo.github.io/Food-For-Thought/. 

The application's HTML, CSS, JS, images, and README files can be accessed from this repository: https://github.com/AliSuleym/Final-Project-1

The application has the following interface:

## Acceptance Criteria
<br>

Given that the user is seeking for a recipe with an item that is readily available, when the user types the name of the ingredient into the search area, an image of the recipe, the ingredients, and the directions are then displayed to the user.
As the user goes down the page, additional recipes using the same ingredient as the user's selection are displayed.
AFTER the consumer hits the recipe's video link
THE user is then brought to a video that demonstrates how to prepare the recipe.
When the application does not have a recipe for a specific ingredient, a graphic showing that there is no such recipe will appear.
The words "No" will appear when an application does not have a recipe video.

## [What The Application Does]

A single word or an ingredient name can be used to search for recipes using this project's interactive web application. The application returns additional recipes that use the same ingredient in addition to the main recipe that corresponds to the search term supplied in the search box when the user clicks the search button, which directs them to the Recipe page. On the main recipe page or the More Recipes page, these are located in four columns.
The recipe includes a video link to an online video that shows how to prepare it for user convenience. The user can view a YouTube video with the recipe by clicking this link.

The user can access other areas of the web application right away by clicking the top navigation links, including the Search page, Recipes page, More Recipes page, and the sites with details about the development team. The user will be returned to the landing page by clicking the website or application name.

## Project Requirements

Use Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.


Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).


Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## [The Technologies Used]

In developing the application, we have used Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Bulma - (CSS Framework), and Vanilla JavaScript.

TheMealDB (https://www.themealdb.com), an open, crowd-sourced database of recipes from all over the world, provided two server-side APIs that has been used. These APIs return JSON data and do not require CORS.
Despite sharing the same source, the two APIs are distinct. The first API retrieves the recipe's name and image, while the second API retrieves the recipe's ingredients, amount of ingredients, videos, and procedures.
