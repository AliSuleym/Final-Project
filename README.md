# Final-Project
[Yummy-Food-Recipes Web Application]

This project, which is an essential step on the road to becoming full-stack developers, challenges us to apply the information and abilities we have learned during the coding bootcamp to create a web application from scratch.

The task is to come up with and putting into practice a design that incorporates data from several server-side API queries to address a real-world issue.

This project seeks to teach us agile development approaches as well as how to integrate features and bug fixes utilizing git branch workflow and pull requests because we will be working collaboratively.

## User Story
<br>

AS A person with an extremely busy schedule who likes to cook or is learning to cook, THE USER IS SEEKING A WEBSITE APPLICATION TO FIND FOOD RECIPE BY INGREDIENTS, So that the user can locate recipes that he or she can simply follow in the shortest amount of time while still allowing him or her to use ingredients that are already in the cupboard or refrigerator.

## Installation
<br>

The application runs in a browser and can be viewed at: https://jasonjayoo.github.io/Food-For-Thought/. 

The application's HTML, CSS, JS, images, and README files can be accessed from this repository: https://github.com/AliSuleym/Final-Project/

The application has the following interface:

## Acceptance Criteria
<br>

Given that the user is seeking for a recipe with an item that is readily available, when the user types the name of the ingredient into the search area, an image of the recipe, the ingredients, and the directions are then displayed to the user.
As the user goes down the page, additional recipes using the same ingredient as the user's selection are displayed.
AFTER the consumer hits the recipe's video link
THE user is then brought to a video that demonstrates how to prepare the recipe.
When the application does not have a recipe for a specific ingredient, a graphic showing that there is no such recipe will appear.
The words "No" will appear when an application does not have a recipe video.
